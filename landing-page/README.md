# Personalized Simple Landing Page with a Little HTML, CSS, JS Magic

## See commented code to see where to make changes

## Example URL strings to append for testing 

/index.html?firstName=Bob&email=test@domain.com&cabin=Cabin%201
/index.html?firstName=Bob&email=test@domain.com&cabin=Cabin%202
/index.html?firstName=Bob&email=test@domain.com&cabin=Cabin%203

## Make sure your image file names are named consistently with your URL param names

For example, the javascript code will parse the URL param and value, "cabin=Cabin 1" into "cabin-1" to switch out the image file.

Have a look at the "img" folder. 

## Sample data inputs

Sample data will work with "Cabin 1, Cabin 2, and Cabin 3. 

If a name that's added (ex: Cabin 4) that doesn't exist or left empty, the default text placeholders and image will be used.
